Low-Level Design (LLD) refers to the detailed design phase in software development, where the specific implementation details of a system are planned out. It involves breaking down the high-level architecture into smaller, detailed modules and components. LLD covers aspects like:

- **Class Diagrams**: Describing the structure of classes and their relationships.
- **Sequence Diagrams**: Illustrating the flow of logic and the interactions between components.
- **State Diagrams**: Showing the states an object can be in and the transitions between those states.
- **Pseudocode or Algorithms**: Providing detailed algorithms for specific functions or processes.

The goal of LLD is to ensure that all parts of the system are clearly defined and can be implemented by developers with a clear understanding of how they fit into the overall system architecture.
